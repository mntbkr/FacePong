# `FacePong` â€” play pong with your face....because I can.

### An excuse to code something so I can learn AngularJS

## Getting Started

Clone the `FacePong` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/mntbkr/FacePong.git
cd FacePong
```

### Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`http://localhost:8000/#!/FacePong`].

This should work with Chrome and Firefox...

I think Edge will also support this but I have not tested.

Safari is a No Op until version 11 lands
